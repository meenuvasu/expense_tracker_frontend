# 💸 Expense Tracker – Project Workflow & Deployment Guide

This project was completed step‑by‑step. Below is the **exact workflow followed**, from development to final presentation.

---

## 1️⃣ Frontend & Backend Development

### Frontend

* Built using **React**
* Features:

  * Add expense
  * View expense list
  * Edit & delete expense
  * Monthly filter and total calculation
* Axios used to connect with backend APIs

### Backend

* Built using **Spring Boot**
* REST APIs for:

  * Create expense
  * Fetch all expenses
  * Update expense
  * Delete expense
  * Filter by month
* Database: **H2 (In‑memory)**

---

## 2️⃣ Push Frontend & Backend to GitHub

* Frontend and backend maintained in **separate repositories**
* Initial commit pushed after successful local testing
* GitHub repositories created and verified

---

## 3️⃣ Proper Pull Request

* Changes were pushed to feature branch
* **Pull Request created** to merge into main branch
* Code reviewed and merged properly

---

## 4️⃣ SonarQube Analysis

* SonarQube used for **static code analysis**
* Checked for:

  * Bugs
  * Code smells
  * Maintainability
* Quality gate verified before proceeding further

  Issue Description:
     SonarQube analysis indicates a FAILED status for the frontend module due to code coverage requirements. 

   Reason:
     Frontend automated test cases have not yet been implemented, which results in low/zero test coverage and causes the Quality Gate to fail.

  Actions Taken:
      All identified bugs and code smells were reviewed and addressed.
      Security Hotspots were reviewed and marked as Safe.
      The remaining failure is only related to test coverage metrics.

  Conclusion:
     The SonarQube failure is limited to coverage constraints and does not reflect issues in code functionality or security.
     Frontend test cases are planned to be added in a future phase to improve coverage and meet Quality Gate requirements.
